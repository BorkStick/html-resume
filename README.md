my resume

I want to set this up in a way that will let me use the same info for multipul resumes depending on what link is sent out

**example:**

give a `tech support` link and just see the info related to that field. computer fixing and whatnot

give out a `web dev` link and it shows webdev skills projects and work history.

## Todo

- [ ] set up basic structure
- [ ] convert md resume to html my resume info
- [ ] add `summary` page
- [ ] add `skills` page
- [ ] add `projects` page
- [ ] add `work history`
- [ ] add `education` page
- [ ] figure out how to make it dynamic depending on the link used
